# Movie Discovery and Recommendation App

## Overview
This project is a **Movie Discovery and Recommendation App** built using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**. The app allows users to explore a curated list of movies, filter them by year and genre, and get personalized recommendations. The app features a modern, responsive design with a dark theme for a cinematic feel.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are:
- To create a user-friendly platform for discovering and exploring movies.
- To implement a responsive and visually appealing design.
- To demonstrate proficiency in modern web development technologies like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.
- To integrate an external API for fetching movie data (though this was not fully achieved due to API limitations).

## Key Features
### 1. **Home Page**
- **Hero Section**: A visually striking section with a background image and a call-to-action button to explore movies.
- **Featured Movies Section**: A grid of movie cards showcasing movie titles, descriptions, and posters.
- **Call-to-Action Section**: Encourages users to sign up for personalized movie recommendations.

### 2. **Movies Page**
- **Search and Filters**: Users can search for movies and filter them by year and genre.
- **Movie Cards**: Each card displays a movie's title, poster, and release year.
- **Pagination**: Allows users to navigate through the movie list.

### 3. **Header and Footer**
- **Header**: Contains navigation links (Home, Movies, Sign Up) and is sticky for easy access.
- **Footer**: Displays copyright information.

### 4. **Responsive Design**
- The app is fully responsive and works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Implementation Process
### 1. **Frontend Development**
- **Next.js**: Used for server-side rendering and routing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling and creating a responsive layout.
- **TypeScript**: Added for type safety and improved developer experience.

### 2. **Components**
- **Header**: A reusable navigation bar.
- **Footer**: A simple footer with copyright information.
- **Button**: A customizable button component.
- **MovieCard**: Displays movie details in a card format.
- **Loading**: A loading spinner displayed during data fetching.

### 3. **Data Fetching**
- The app was designed to fetch movie data from an external API (e.g., TMDB, OMDb). However, due to issues with API availability, static data was used for demonstration purposes.

### 4. **Deployment**
- The app was deployed on **Vercel** for easy access and sharing.

## Evaluation Criteria
The project was evaluated based on the following criteria:
1. **Functionality**:
   - Does the app work as expected?
   - Are all features (e.g., search, filters, pagination) implemented?
2. **Design**:
   - Is the app visually appealing?
   - Is the layout responsive and user-friendly?
3. **Code Quality**:
   - Is the code clean, modular, and well-documented?
   - Are best practices followed (e.g., TypeScript, reusable components)?
4. **Deployment**:
   - Is the app successfully deployed and accessible?

## Challenges Faced
### API Integration
- **Issue**: Despite multiple attempts, I was unable to generate a working API key from popular movie API providers (e.g., TMDB, OMDb, RapidAPI). All sites either required payment, had strict usage limits, or failed to provide a functional API key.
- **Workaround**: Static data was used to demonstrate the app's functionality. This allowed me to focus on building the frontend and user experience.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to build a modern, responsive web application using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. While I faced challenges with API integration, I was able to create a fully functional and visually appealing movie discovery app. I look forward to improving this project further by integrating a reliable movie API in the future.
